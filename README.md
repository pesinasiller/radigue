# Radigue

An additive synthesizer made with just one line of javascript code, a reference to the minimalism of french artist Eliane Radigue.

The idea behind additive synthesis is based on the Fourier theorem, which states that any waveform can be represented as the sum of sine waves of different frequencies and amplitudes.

This means that, in principle, you can recreate any possible sound by specifying the frequency, amplitude, and phase of each harmonic component.
